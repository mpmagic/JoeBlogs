This fork contains the implementation of the XML-RPC "post_thumbnail" attribute on post editing,
as wp_post_thumbnail, which allows Wordpress to associate a "featured image" to the post.
The changes involve the return of the image id when uploaded, in addition to the URL from the master,
and the addition of member PostThumbnail to class Post. The PostThumbnail is a string that contains
the Wordpress ID of the image.
